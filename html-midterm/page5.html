    <h1> Changelog </h1>
    <p> Lists of changes in page 1: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>I added the "DOCTYPE html" at the top of page 1. </li>
        <li>it was missing the "html lang="en"" at the top after DOCTYPE so i added it below that. </li>
        <li>In line 81 there was a tag for em but it was written as e so I added the m and / so its /em.  </li>
        <li>The ' was also flagged so I changed them by writing them as ' again. In line 39, 57, 59, 60, 74, 84, 106, and 117. </li>
        <li>In line 77 the closing tag was missing the / for p so I added it.  </li>
        <li>I also added the html closing tag at the end of the document/code.  </li>
    </ol>

    <p> Lists of changes in page 2: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>In line 27, there was an end tag for b but wasn't written correctly so I corrected it to "/b". </li>
        <li>I indented the p on line 26 to match the ending indentation of the closing p. </li>      
        <li>On line 53, there is a p tag and a h2 tag, you don't need the p tag for the h2 tag so I removed the p tag.  </li>
        <li>On line 57, the link isn't actually linked to anything so I took the wikipedia page of segmental arch and linked it by putting in the website. </li>
        <li>Discription, Interior, History, and Closure all need to be h2 instead of the random different h's. I changed it to be h2.  </li>

        <li>I also added the html closing tag at the end of the document/code.  </li>
        <li>  </li>
        <li>  </li> 
    </ol>

    <p> Lists of changes in page 3: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>On line 53 the list tag should be li not l so I added an i on both closing and opening tags. </li>
        <li>On line 82, for the table the ending tag for td was inccorected so I corrected by added td after the /. </li>      
        <li>On line 82, for lily that is supposed to go lower below the tr in line 84 so I put lily into the 3rd row of names.  </li>
        <li>I moved the ago 22 onto the 4th row which is after line 90. </li>
        <li>Line 98, I moved Axelia down to line 100 which is the last row.  </li>
        <li>On line 80 Zapata is wrapped in th when its supposed to be td so I changed the tag to td.  </li>
